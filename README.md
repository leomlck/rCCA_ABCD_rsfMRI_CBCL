# Regularized CCA Identifies Sex-Specific Brain-Behavior Associations in Adolescent Psychopathology

This project investigates sex-specific associations between resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fMRI) and psychiatric symptoms in early adolescence using the ABCD dataset. Using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and rigorous cross-validation, we identify multivariate brain-behavior mappings across eight Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) syndrome scales. In contrast to previous studies, we explicitly model sex differences in these brain-behavior associations, revealing distinct neural correlates for attention, thought, and internalizing problems in males and females. Our findings highlight the importance of considering sex-specific mechanisms in adolescent psychopathology and support the development of sex-informed clinical strategies.

## Data

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development℠ (ABCD) Study ([https://abcdstudy.org](https://abcdstudy.org)), publicly released in the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). This is a multisite, longitudinal study designed to recruit more than 10,000 children age 9–10 and follow them over 10 years into early adulthood.
